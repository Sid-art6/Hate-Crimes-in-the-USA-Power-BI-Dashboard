# Hate-Crimes-in-the-USA-Power-BI-Dashboard

### 📖 Project Description

This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze hate crimes in the United States. The dashboard leverages hate crime datasets to uncover key insights into how these incidents vary by state, year, and bias motivation (such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender).

The primary objective is to provide a clear and accessible view of hate crime trends, helping policymakers, researchers, and communities identify where interventions are most needed. The dashboard enables users to:

Monitor trends over time to understand whether hate crimes are rising or declining.

Compare state-level data to highlight geographic hotspots.

Examine bias motivations to see which groups are most affected.

Visualize key metrics, including the number of incidents, victims, and offenders.

By combining data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive visuals, this project demonstrates the value of business intelligence tools in transforming raw crime data into actionable insights. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly, allowing non-technical users to explore insights through slicers, filters, and interactive charts.

This project highlights skills in data cleaning, modeling, and visualization using Power BI, and demonstrates how data analytics can support evidence-based decision making in critical social issues.

### 🎯 Objectives

Track the number of hate crime incidents across states and years.

Analyze crime categories and affected groups.

Identify geographic hotspots for hate crimes.

Provide an easy-to-use dashboard for data-driven decision making.
